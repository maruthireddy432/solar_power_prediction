## 🌞 Solar Power Prediction Dashboard ⚡

# 🌟 Key Features
  - Accurate Predictions: Use weather parameters like temperature, wind speed, sky cover, etc., to predict solar power generation.
  - Dynamic Visualizations: View interactive plots of the dataset and model performance metrics.
  - Model Comparison: Analyze the metrics of different machine learning models used for prediction.
  - Data Exploration: Examine the dataset used for model training directly in the app.
# 🌐 How It Works
Model Input:
 - Users provide weather parameters like distance to solar noon, temperature, wind speed, sky cover, visibility, and humidity.
 - Machine Learning Model:
 - The pre-trained regression model (solar_model.pkl) processes the input and predicts the expected solar power generation.
 - Interactive Outputs:
  - Predictions are displayed instantly.
